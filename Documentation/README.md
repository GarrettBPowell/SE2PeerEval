Abstract Classes:

- The Team class is abstract because a team must contain members in order to exist, and the functions of the team will be inherited by each member.

Final Classes:

- The Team Member class is final because there is no class in this assignment which needs to inherit all attributes and methods of the Team Member class. The Team Member class is the lowest class in the hierarchy.
