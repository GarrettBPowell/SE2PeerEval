Strengths: 
  - Organization
  - Debugging 
  - Scheduling meetings/keeping track of what is decided on at meetings 
  
What I plan to do: 
  - Ensure that we are meeting on a weekly basis 
  - Make sure that we don't fall behind on the project by making sure everyone is aware of what needs to be done (Hopefully, this is more of just writing it down so that we don't forget?) 
  - Debugging/testing/planning
  - Am able to flex and fill any position that we need filled; just depends on how much everyone likes different aspects of coding 
  - Handle documentation
